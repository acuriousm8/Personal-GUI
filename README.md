# Personal-GUI
My personal GUI was made for me to mess around in c# and GUIs. Each "app"/screen essentially acts as its own program and has no connection to other screens.
## Features
* Contains an auto typer
* a program closer (task manager esk)
* Hue lights interface
* audio output switcher
## Known Issues
* The Hue lights implementation is unfinished but functions
* The audio switcher contains a bug that'll crash the program if you switch devices before loading an updated version of the variables (looking into a queue for it that would fix the issue, but a better solution would be fixing the audio switcher)
